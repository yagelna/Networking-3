# Networking-3
As part of a Introduction to Networking course, we explored the use of parity bits and parity matrices for detecting and correcting errors in binary messages. We simulated a sender, receiver, and a noisy channel with varying probabilities of bit flips. The goal was to measure the efficiency of different error-correcting and error-detecting codes.
